# Hi, I am Paul

Welcome.

I’m someone who writes code. Most of my time is spent exploring **distributed systems** and **AI application development**, and I also work across the stack when needed.

More than the tools themselves, I care about *why* a system is designed a certain way, *why* code is written the way it is, and whether these choices actually make things better in the real world.

This blog is not a portfolio, and it’s not purely a technical blog either.

It’s more like a long-term notebook a place to record what I’m learning, what I’m working on, mistakes I’ve made, and thoughts that show up along the way.

## What I’m currently focused on

- **Distributed Systems**  
  Interested in high-concurrency systems, reliability, and how architectures evolve over time. I enjoy breaking down the trade-offs behind complex system designs.

- **AI Applications & Large Language Models**  
  Exploring how LLMs are applied in real products including RAG, agents, and tool use and how they change the way we interact with software.

- **Full-Stack Development**  
  I don’t like being confined to a single layer. Backend, frontend, and infrastructure all matter if you want to build something complete, not just your own small part.


## Tools I often use (and change over time)

- **Backend**: Node.js, Go, PostgreSQL, Redis  
- **Frontend**: React, Astro, Tailwind CSS  
- **AI**: LangChain, OpenAI API, LlamaIndex  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions  

Tools come and go. The problems and thinking tend to stay.


## About this blog

Here you’ll find:

- Technical notes (not always written as tutorials)
- Thoughts on system design and technology trends
- Notes from life and personal reflections
- Questions I haven’t fully figured out yet

If something here happens to be useful to you, that’s great.  
If not, at least it’s honest to me.
